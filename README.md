# SmartAgri-Predictor
SmartAgri Predictor – Crop Yield and Fertilizer Recommendation System SmartAgri Predictor is an AI-powered agricultural decision-support system designed to enhance farming efficiency by accurately predicting crop yields and recommending optimal fertilizers. 

📌 Project Overview
Agriculture is one of the most crucial sectors for global food security. However, challenges such as unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and inappropriate fertilizer use impact yield quality and quantity. This ML-based system leverages historical and real-time data to:

Predict the most suitable crop for given conditions.

Estimate the expected yield for that crop.

Recommend the best fertilizer to use based on soil and crop type.

✅ Features
📊 Crop Recommendation: Based on soil NPK values, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

🌾 Yield Prediction: Estimates expected output using regression models.

💊 Fertilizer Suggestion: Recommends fertilizer by comparing nutrient deficits.

📈 User-friendly Interface (Streamlit/Flask web app)

💾 Dataset Preprocessing & Cleaning for better accuracy.

📉 Model Evaluation Metrics included (accuracy, RMSE, etc.)

🔍 How It Works
Input: User provides environmental and soil inputs (N, P, K, temperature, pH, etc.)

Processing:

Crop recommendation through classification models (e.g., Random Forest)

Yield prediction using regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree)

Fertilizer suggestions based on nutrient deficiency

Output: Display of crop name, predicted yield (kg/hectare), and fertilizer suggestion.
